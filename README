After getting sick of unreadable color schemes because of OS X's Terminal.app color rendition I decided to make my own scheme. The focus is on providing readable combinations of colors.

This may also look okay in other terminals, but I haven't really tested it there so far.

Currently it does nothing special for Gvim.

If you would like to leave comments or make suggestions for this color scheme, please visit my blog: http://kamilkisiel.blogspot.com/2008/11/enzymevim-terminalapp-friendly-color.html
